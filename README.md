# Trading Bot
This repository contains a simple yet extensible object-oriented trading strategy framework built in Python. The base class, MyTradingStrategy, defines a common interface for all strategies, while MySMAStrat implements a Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossover strategy. The bot generates Buy, Sell, or Hold signals based on the relationship between short-term and long-term moving averages of price data.

Designed for clarity and modularity, this framework can be expanded to include additional indicators, real-time data integration, and automated execution logicâ€”serving as a strong foundation for more advanced algorithmic trading systems.
